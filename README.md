📊 **Key Insights**
When 1 in 6 employees leave despite being satisfied, it’s clear: retention takes more than just smiles on surveys- this is what I learnt after dealing with the dataset on Blackmores, a supplement manufacturing company in Australia
Here are the most interesting and less obvious insights from the Blackmores HR dataset:

🔍 High Satisfaction, yet 56% of the people working in the R & D department chose to leave. 52 employees with job satisfaction ratings of 4 or higher, left the company-isn’t it appalling? Risk of silent disengagement in most strategic departments.

🧱 Is it really surprising that 266 employees who spent over five years in the same role without a single promotion decided to leave the company? Probably not.

💸Gender-based income disparities, particularly at senior levels, reflect systemic issues that no modern organization can afford to ignore. The role of Research Director shows a striking $1,500+ average monthly income gap between genders.

🧊At a median age of just 36, young and enthusiastic talent is walking away — raising red flags for future leadership. 

✨ Ironically, the very backbone of the company — talent with Life Sciences (89 employees) qualifications — is walking out the door.

This is the moment for Blackmores to act — rising attrition across key talent pools demands urgent attention.
